[H[2J		H-BOND/SALT BRIDGE BOND LENGTH & ANGLE CRITERIA

Default H-bond & salt bridge list has been compiled and written to
'_proflexdataset' file. It includes intra- and inter-molecular
H-bonds meeting the following default stereochemical criteria:


	Hydrogen-Acceptor (H-A) distance <= 2.5 Angstrom
	                with Sulfur atom <= 3.0 Angstrom
	                for Salt bridge  <= 3.5 Angstrom

	Donor-Acceptor (D-A) distance    <= 3.5 Angstrom
	             with Sulfur atom    <= 4.0 Angstrom
	              for Salt bridge    <= 4.5 Angstrom

	Theta (D-H-A angle)              >= 110 Degree
	Delta (H-A-Pre-acceptor angle)   >= 90  Degree

Indices of H-bonds filtered more stringently (see below) are written to
'_h-bonds_SEfilt' file.

Do you wish to impose more stringent rules? (y/n): y
[H[2J
	Enter H-A Distance (<= 2.5 A): 2.45

	Enter H-A Distance for H-bonds with Sulfur (<= 3.0 A): 3.0

	Enter H-A Distance for Salt Bridges (<= 3.5 A): 3.45

	Enter D-A Distance (<= 3.5): 3.45

	Enter D-A Distance for H-bonds with Sulfur (<= 4.0): 4.0

	Enter D-A Distance for Salt Bridges (<= 4.5): 4.45

	Enter Theta Angle (>= 110): 110

	Enter Delta Angle (>= 90): 90

	Number of H-bonds remaining: 187
	Number of hydrophobic tethers remaining: 121

			NON-COVALENT BOND SCREENING OPTIONS MENU

	 1 : Keep *ALL* H-bonds involving WATER 
		(Select this ONLY if you have included only
		 buried water molecules in the input PDB file)
	 2 : Remove *ALL* H-bonds involving sidechain atoms
	 3 : Remove *ALL* H-bonds involving non-water HETATOMs
	 4 : Remove hydrophobic tethers
	 5 : Use defaults (keep hydrophobic tethers and H-bonds except those including water)

	 f : Finished selecting options; Continue to next step
	 s : Stop program

	Enter Option: 5



		SELECTED SCREENING OPTIONS

	 5 Use defaults (keep hydrophobic tethers and H-bonds except those including water)

	Do you accept these options? (y)es or (no): y

Number of H-bonds remaining: 155

Number of H-phobic tethers remaining: 121

		 Filter on Hydrogen Bond Energy:
		 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	All current hydrogen bonds have energies between:
	    -9.9539 Kcal/Mol  to  2.5075 Kcal/Mol

	Enter a maximum acceptable hydrogen bond energy (in Kcal/Mol): -2.3


    ANALYSIS MENU

  What would you like to perform:

    (1) Flexibility and rigidity analysis
    (2) Hydrogen bond dilution
2
       
  Which hydrogen bond dilution analysis would you like?

   (1) Standard hydrogen bond dilution, removing weakestH-bonds, one at a time

   (2) Random dilution over all H-bonds.
       NOTE: This option is *not* recommended;
             It may be used to probe the influence of H-bond
             density, as opposed to strength, on rigidity

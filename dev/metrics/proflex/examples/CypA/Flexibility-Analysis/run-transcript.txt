    Usage : /home/namiliko/proflex/V5.0_files/2008/testversion/proflexv5.0/prog/../bin/proflex [-r] [-e] [-nonh|nonf] <-h|{-p|-pw}> <filename>

    <filename> Expected to have a .pdb or .PDB file extension.
	       With the -p or -pw option the extension may be _proflexdataset.


	Option definitions:

	-nonh  Use for non-interactive hydrogen bond dilution.

	-nonf  Use for non-interactive flexibility analysis.

	       **NOTE: Any filtering using stereochemical, energy,
			hydrophobic, side chain, and water criteria from the
			previous ProFlex run generating the proflex_dataset file
			are not applied in -non mode.  Only the default stereochemical
			criteria are applied. Be sure to only include buried
			water molecules in the input PDB file.**

	-h     Use with a PDB file having hydrogens.
	       Hydrogens can be added explicitly by programs like WhatIf.

	-r     Distance between van der Wal's surfaces of atoms participating
	       in a hydrophobic interaction. 0.5 is default.

	-e     Max energy a hydrogen bond can have to be included in the analysis.

	-p     Use when the original PDB file has been previously processed.
	       *proflexdataset* file from previous run must exist in the same directory.

	-pw    Same as [-p] except previous warning messages are re-displayed.

		H-BOND/SALT BRIDGE BOND LENGTH & ANGLE CRITERIA

Default H-bond & salt bridge list has been compiled and written to
'_proflexdataset' file. It includes intra- and inter-molecular
H-bonds meeting the following default stereochemical criteria:


	Hydrogen-Acceptor (H-A) distance <= 2.5 Angstroms
	                with Sulfur atom <= 3.0 Angstroms
	                for Salt bridge  <= 3.5 Angstroms

	Donor-Acceptor (D-A) distance    <= 3.5 Angstroms
	             with Sulfur atom    <= 4.0 Angstroms
	              for Salt bridge    <= 4.5 Angstroms

	Theta (D-H-A angle)              >= 110 Degrees
	Delta (H-A-Pre-acceptor angle)   >= 90  Degrees

Indices of H-bonds filtered more stringently (see below) are written to
'_h-bonds_SEfilt' file.

Do you wish to impose more stringent rules? (y/n): y

	Enter H-A Distance (<= 2.5 A): 2.5

	Enter H-A Distance for H-bonds with Sulfur (<= 3.0 A): 3.0

	Enter H-A Distance for salt bridges (<= 3.5 A): 3.5

	Enter D-A Distance (<= 3.5): 3.5

	Enter D-A Distance for H-bonds with Sulfur (<= 4.0): 4.0

	Enter D-A Distance for salt bridges (<= 4.5): 4.5

	Enter Theta Angle (>= 110): 111

	Enter Delta Angle (>= 90): 91

	Number of H-bonds remaining: 193
	Number of hydrophobic tethers remaining: 121

		 buried water molecules in the input PDB file)
	 2 : Remove *ALL* H-bonds involving sidechain atoms
	 3 : Remove *ALL* H-bonds involving non-water HETATOMs
	 4 : Remove hydrophobic tethers
	 5 : Use defaults (keep hydrophobic tethers and H-bonds except those including water)

	 f : Finished selecting options; Continue to next step
	 s : Stop program

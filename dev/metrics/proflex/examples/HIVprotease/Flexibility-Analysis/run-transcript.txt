		H-BOND/SALT BRIDGE BOND LENGTH & ANGLE CRITERIA

Default H-bond & salt bridge list has been compiled and written to
'_proflexdataset' file. It includes intra- and inter-molecular
H-bonds meeting the following default stereochemical criteria:


	Hydrogen-Acceptor (H-A) distance <= 2.5 Angstroms
	                with Sulfur atom <= 3.0 Angstroms
	                for Salt bridge  <= 3.5 Angstroms

	Donor-Acceptor (D-A) distance    <= 3.5 Angstroms
	             with Sulfur atom    <= 4.0 Angstroms
	              for Salt bridge    <= 4.5 Angstroms

	Theta (D-H-A angle)              >= 110 Degrees
	Delta (H-A-Pre-acceptor angle)   >= 90  Degrees

Indices of H-bonds filtered more stringently (see below) are written to
'_h-bonds_SEfilt' file.

Do you wish to impose more stringent rules? (y/n): n

	Number of H-bonds remaining: 170
	Number of hydrophobic tethers remaining: 131

			NON-COVALENT BOND SCREENING OPTIONS MENU

	 1 : Keep *ALL* H-bonds involving WATER 
		(Select this ONLY if you have included only
		 buried water molecules in the input PDB file)
	 2 : Remove *ALL* H-bonds involving sidechain atoms
	 3 : Remove *ALL* H-bonds involving non-water HETATOMs
	 4 : Remove hydrophobic tethers
	 5 : Use defaults (keep hydrophobic tethers and H-bonds except those including water)

	 f : Finished selecting options; Continue to next step
	 s : Stop program

	Enter Option: 5



		SELECTED SCREENING OPTIONS

	 5 Use defaults (keep hydrophobic tethers and H-bonds except those including water)

	Do you accept these options? (y)es or (no): y

Number of H-bonds remaining: 170

Number of H-phobic tethers remaining: 131

		 Filter on Hydrogen Bond Energy:
		 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	All current hydrogen bonds have energies between:
	    -9.8806 Kcal/Mol  to  8.2438 Kcal/Mol

	Enter a maximum acceptable hydrogen bond energy (in Kcal/Mol)
	(-1.0 is a reasonable cutoff in general): -1.0

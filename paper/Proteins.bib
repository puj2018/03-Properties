abstract = {We present a comprehensive evaluation of a new structure mining method called PB-ALIGN. It is based on the encoding of protein structure as 1D sequence of a combination of 16 short structural motifs or protein blocks (PBs). PBs are short motifs capable of representing most of the local structural features of a protein backbone. Using derived PB substitution matrix and simple dynamic programming algorithm, PB sequences are aligned the same way amino acid sequences to yield structure alignment. PBs are short motifs capable of representing most of the local structural features of a protein backbone. Alignment of these local features as sequence of symbols enables fast detection of structural similarities between two proteins. Ability of the method to characterize and align regions beyond regular secondary structures, for example, N and C caps of helix and loops connecting regular structures, puts it a step ahead of existing methods, which strongly rely on secondary structure elements. PB-ALIGN achieved efficiency of 85\% in extracting true fold from a large database of 7259 SCOP domains and was successful in 82\% cases to identify true super-family members. On comparison to 13 existing structure comparison/mining methods, PB-ALIGN emerged as the best on general ability test dataset and was at par with methods like YAKUSA and CE on nontrivial test dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method performed well when compared to flexible structure alignment method like FATCAT and outperforms in processing speed (less than 45 s per database scan). This work also establishes a reliable cut-off value for the demarcation of similar folds. It finally shows that global alignment scores of unrelated structures using PBs follow an extreme value distribution. PB-ALIGN is freely available on web server called Protein Block Expert (PBE) at http://bioinformatics.univ-reunion.fr/PBE/.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that a protein’s primary sequence determines its three-dimensional structure. It has proved difficult, however, to obtain detailed structural information about the actual protein folding process and intermediate states. We present the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the unfolding of reduced bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The resulting partially “denatured” state was compact but expanded relative to the native state (ll-25\%); the expansion was not caused by an influx of water molecules. The structures were mobile, with overall secondary structure contents comparable to those of the native protein. The protein experienced relatively local unfolding, with the largest changes in the structure occurring in the loop regions. A hydrophobic core was maintained although packing of the side chains was compromised. The properties displayed in the simulation are consistent with unfolding to a molten globule state. Our simulations provide an in-depth view of this state and details of water-protein interactions that cannot yet be obtained experimentally.},

abstract = {The hydrophobic effect is a major driving force in all chemical and biological events involving chain collapse in aqueous solution. Here, we show that the burial of nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area (NSASA) is a powerful criterion to predict the folding and misfolding behavior of small single-domain proteins as a function of chain elongation. This bears fundamental implications for co- and post-translational protein folding in the cell and for understanding the interplay between noncovalent interactions and formation of native-like structure and topology. Comparison between the fraction of NSASA in fully unfolded and folded elongating chains shows that efficient burial of nonpolar surface area is preferentially achieved only when the polypeptide chain is almost complete. This effect has no preferential vectorial character in that it is present upon elongation from both the N and C termini. For incomplete chains that do not have the ability to fold and bury nonpolar surface intramolecularly, the overall hydrophobic nature of the polypeptide chain (expressed as FBA, i.e., fractional buried surface area per residue) dictates the tendency toward misfolding and self-association. N-terminal chains characterized by FBA exceeding 0.73 are likely to misfold and aggregate, if unable to fold intramolecularly.},

We have identified, in the thermal unfolding of the apoflavodoxin from Anabaena PCC 7119, an equilibrium intermediate with spectroscopic properties of a molten globule and substantial enthalpy and heat capacity of unfolding. The structure of the intermediate is probed by mutagenesis (and phi analysis) of polar residues involved in surface-exposed hydrogen bonds connecting secondary-structure elements in the native protein. All hydrogen bonds analysed are formed in the molten globule intermediate, either with native strength or debilitated. This suggests the overall intermediate's topology and surface tertiary interactions are close to native, and indicates that hydrogen bonding may contribute significantly to shape the conformation and energetics of folding intermediates.},

The library was generated using an automated method for finding correlations between protein sequence and local structure, and contains most previously described local sequence-structure correlations as well as new relationships, including a diverging type-II b-turn, a frayed helix, and a proline-terminated helix. The query sequence is scanned for segments 7 to 19 residues in length that strongly match one of the 82 patterns in the library. Matching segments are assigned the three-dimensional structure characteristic of the corresponding sequence pattern, and backbone torsion angles for the entire query sequence are then predicted by piecing together mutually compatible segment predictions. In predictions of local structure in a test set of 55 proteins, about 50\% of all residues, and 76\% of residues covered by high-confdence predictions, were found in eight-residue segments within 1.4 A of their true structures. The predictions are complementary to traditional secondary structure predictions because they are considerably more specific in turn regions, and may contribute to ab initio tertiary structure prediction and fold recognition.},

abstract = {The quantification of the packing of residues in proteins and docking of ligands to macromolecules is important in understanding protein stability and drug design. The number of atoms in contact (within a distance of 4.5 A) can be used to describe the local environment of a residue. As this number increases, the accessible surface area (ASA) of the residue decreases exponentially and the variation can be described in terms of an exponential equation of the form y = a(1)exp(-x/a(2)), each residue having its own set of parameters a(1) and a(2), which also depend on whether the whole residue or just the side chain is considered. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues can be distinguished on the basis of both the average number of surrounding atoms and the variation of ASA. For a given number of partner atoms, a comparison of the observed ASA with the expected value obtained from the equation provides a method of assessing the goodness of packing of the residue in a protein structure or its importance in the binding of a ligand. The equation provides a method to estimate the ASA of a protein molecule and the average relative accessibilities of different residues, the latter being inversely correlated with hydrophobicity values.},

abstract = {The objective of this review is to enable researchers to use the software package Rosetta for biochemical and biomedicinal studies. We provide a brief review of the six most frequent research problems tackled with Rosetta. For each of these six tasks, we provide a tutorial that illustrates a basic Rosetta protocol. The Rosetta method was originally developed for de novo protein structure prediction and is regularly one of the best performers in the community-wide biennial Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction. Predictions for protein domains with fewer than 125 amino acids regularly have a backbone root-mean-square deviation of better than 5.0 A. More impressively, there are several cases in which Rosetta has been used to predict structures with atomic level accuracy better than 2.5 A. In addition to de novo structure prediction, Rosetta also has methods for molecular docking, homology modeling, determining protein structures from sparse experimental NMR or EPR data, and protein design. Rosetta has been used to accurately design a novel protein structure, predict the structure of protein-protein complexes, design altered specificity protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and stabilize proteins and protein complexes. Most recently, Rosetta has been used to solve the X-ray crystallographic phase problem.},

abstract = {By using an unsupervised cluster analyzer, we have identified a local structural alphabet composed of 16 folding patterns of five consecutive C(alpha) ("protein blocks"). The dependence that exists between successive blocks is explicitly taken into account. A Bayesian approach based on the relation protein block-amino acid propensity is used for prediction and leads to a success rate close to 35\%. Sharing sequence windows associated with certain blocks into "sequence families" improves the prediction accuracy by 6\%. This prediction accuracy exceeds 75\% when keeping the first four predicted protein blocks at each site of the protein. In addition, two different strategies are proposed: the first one defines the number of protein blocks in each site needed for respecting a user-fixed prediction accuracy, and alternatively, the second one defines the different protein sites to be predicted with a user-fixed number of blocks and a chosen accuracy. This last strategy applied to the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (alpha/beta protein) shows that 91\% of the sites may be predicted with a prediction accuracy larger than 77\% considering only three blocks per site. The prediction strategies proposed improve our knowledge about sequence-structure dependence and should be very useful in ab initio protein modelling.},

abstract = {The BioShell package has recently been extended with a web server for protein homology detection based on profile-to-profile alignment (known as 1D threading). Its aim is to assign structural templates to each domain of the query. The server uses sequence profiles that describe observed sequence variability and secondary structure profiles providing expected probability for a certain secondary structure type at a given position in a protein. Three independent predictors are used to increase the rate of successful predictions. Careful evaluation shows that there is nearly 80\% chance that the query sequence belongs to the same SCOP family as the top scoring template.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ever since the ground-breaking work of Anfinsen et al. in which a denatured protein was found to refold to its native state, it has been frequently stated by the protein fold prediction community that all the information required for protein folding lies in the amino acid sequence. Recent in vitro experiments and in silico computational studies, however, have shown that cotranslation may affect the folding pathway of some proteins, especially those of ancient folds. In this paper aspects of cotranslational folding have been incorporated into a protein structure prediction algorithm by adapting the Rosetta program to fold proteins as the nascent chain elongates. This makes it possible to conduct a pairwise comparison of folding accuracy, by comparing folds created sequentially from each end of the protein. RESULTS: A single main result emerged: in 94\% of proteins analyzed, following the sense of translation, from N-terminus to C-terminus, produced better predictions than following the reverse sense of translation, from the C-terminus to N-terminus. Two secondary results emerged. First, this superiority of N-terminus to C-terminus folding was more marked for proteins showing stronger evidence of cotranslation and second, an algorithm following the sense of translation produced predictions comparable to, and occasionally better than, Rosetta. CONCLUSIONS: There is a directionality effect in protein fold prediction. At present, prediction methods appear to be too noisy to take advantage of this effect; as techniques refine, it may be possible to draw benefit from a sequential approach to protein fold prediction.},

The universal features of folding, though, are observed just close to the equilibrium point. Here the 'two-state' transition proceeds without any accumulation of metastable intermediates, and only the transition state ('folding nucleus') is outlined by its key influence on the folding-unfolding kinetics.

It is shown that in order to reproduce the physics of the folding transition, the united atom based model requires a set of knowledge-based potentials mimicking the short-range conformational propensities and protein-like chain stiffness, a model of directional and cooperative hydrogen bonds, and properly designed knowledge-based potentials of the long-range interactions between the side groups. The folding of the model protein is cooperative and very fast. In a single trajectory, a number of folding/unfolding cycles were observed. Typically, the folding process is initiated by assembly of a native-like structure of the C-terminal hairpin. In the next stage the rest of the four-ribbon beta-sheet folds. The slowest step of this pathway is the assembly of the central helix on the scaffold of the beta-sheet.},

abstract = {Reconstructing a protein in three dimensions from its backbone torsion angles is an ongoing challenge because minor inaccuracies in these angles produce major errors in the structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm, the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Even accurate knowledge of the backbone torsions $\phi$ and $\Psi$ is insufficient, owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, also lead to major errors in the structure. Against this background, we conducted a computational experiment to assess whether protein conformation can be determined from highly approximate backbone torsion angles, the kind of information that is now obtained readily from NMR. Specifically, backbone torsion angles were taken from proteins of known structure and mapped into 60° × 60° grid squares, called mesostates. Side-chain atoms beyond the $\beta$ -carbon were discarded. A mesostate representation of the protein backbone was then used to extract likely candidates from a fragment library of mesostate pentamers, followed by Monte Carlo-based fragment-assembly simulations to identify stable conformations compatible with the given mesostate sequence. Only three simple energy terms were used to gauge stability: molecular compaction, soft-sphere repulsion, and hydrogen bonding. For the six representative proteins described here, stable conformers can be partitioned into a remarkably small number of topologically distinct clusters. Among these, the native topology is found with high frequency and can be identified as the cluster with the most favorable energy.},

In this account we outline the structural details of the actual unfolding process between the native and molten globule states. The first steps of unfolding involved expansion of the protein, which disrupted packing interactions. The solvent-accessible surface area also quickly increased. The unfolding was localized mostly to the turn and loop regions of the molecule, while leaving the secondary structure intact. Then, there was more gradual unfolding of the secondary structure and non-native turns became prevalent. This same trajectory was continued and more drastic unfolding occurred that resulted in a relatively compact state devoid of stable secondary structure.},

We have set up a hidden Markov model that discretizes protein backbone conformation as series of overlapping fragments (states) of four residues length. This approach learns simultaneously the geometry of the states and their connections. We obtain, using a statistical criterion, an optimal systematic decomposition of the conformational variability of the protein peptidic chain in 27 states with strong connection logic. This result is stable over different protein sets. Our model fits well the previous knowledge related to protein architecture organisation and seems able to grab some subtle details of protein organisation, such as helix sub-level organisation schemes. Taking into account the dependence between the states results in a description of local protein structure of low complexity. On an average, the model makes use of only 8.3 states among 27 to describe each position of a protein structure. Although we use short fragments, the learning process on entire protein conformations captures the logic of the assembly on a larger scale. Using such a model, the structure of proteins can be reconstructed with an average accuracy close to 1.1A root-mean-square deviation and for a complexity of only 3. Finally, we also observe that sequence specificity increases with the number of states of the structural alphabet. Such models can constitute a very relevant approach to the analysis of protein architecture in particular for protein structure prediction.},

@article{Haspel2003,
abstract = {Understanding, and ultimately predicting, how a 1-D protein chain reaches its native 3-D fold has been one of the most challenging problems during the last few decades. Data increasingly indicate that protein folding is a hierarchical process. Hence, the question arises as to whether we can use the hierarchical concept to reduce the practically intractable computational times. For such a scheme to work, the first step is to cut the protein sequence into fragments that form local minima on the polypeptide chain. The conformations of such fragments in solution are likely to be similar to those when the fragments are embedded in the native fold, although alternate conformations may be favored during the mutual stabilization in the combinatorial assembly process. Two elements are needed for such cutting: (1) a library of (clustered) fragments derived from known protein structures and (2) an assignment algorithm that selects optimal combinations to "cover" the protein sequence. The next two steps in hierarchical folding schemes, not addressed here, are the combinatorial assembly of the fragments and finally, optimization of the obtained conformations. Here, we address the first step in a hierarchical protein-folding scheme. The input is a target protein sequence and a library of fragments created by clustering building blocks that were generated by cutting all protein structures. The output is a set of cutout fragments. We briefly outline a graph theoretic algorithm that automatically assigns building blocks to the target sequence, and we describe a sample of the results we have obtained.},

@article{Kmiecik2006,
abstract = {Conformations of globular proteins in the denatured state were studied using a high-resolution lattice model of proteins and Monte Carlo dynamics. The model assumes a united-atom and high-coordination lattice representation of the polypeptide conformational space. The force field of the model mimics the short-range protein-like conformational stiffness, hydrophobic interactions of the side chains and the main-chain hydrogen bonds. Two types of approximations for the short-range interactions were compared: simple statistical potentials and knowledge-based protein-specific potentials derived from the sequence-structure compatibility of short fragments of protein chains. Model proteins in the denatured state are relatively compact, although the majority of the sampled conformations are globally different from the native fold. At the same time short protein fragments are mostly native-like. Thus, the denatured state of the model proteins has several features of the molten globule state observed experimentally. Statistical potentials induce native-like conformational propensities in the denatured state, especially for the fragments located in the core of folded proteins. Knowledge-based protein-specific potentials increase only slightly the level of similarity to the native conformations, in spite of their qualitatively higher specificity in the native structures. For a few cases, where fairly accurate experimental data exist, the simulation results are in semiquantitative agreement with the physical picture revealed by the experiments. This shows that the model studied in this work could be used efficiently in computational studies of protein dynamics in the denatured state, and consequently for studies of protein folding pathways, i.e. not only for the modeling of folded structures, as it was shown in previous studies. The results of the present studies also provide a new insight into the explanation of the Levinthal's paradox.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: This study presents a novel investigation of the effect of kinetic control on cotranslational protein folding. We demonstrate the effect using simple HP lattice models and show that the cotranslational folding of proteins under kinetic control has a significant impact on the final conformation. Differences arise if nature is not capable of pushing a partially folded protein back over a large energy barrier. For this reason we argue that such constraints should be incorporated into structure prediction techniques. We introduce a finite surmountable energy barrier which allows partially formed chains to partly unfold, and permits us to enumerate exhaustively all energy pathways. RESULTS: We compare the ground states obtained sequentially with the global ground states of designing sequences (those with a unique global ground state).We find that the sequential ground states become less numerous and more compact as the surmountable energy barrier increases. We also introduce a probabilistic model to describe the distribution of final folds and allow partial settling to the Boltzmann distribution of states at each stage. As a result, conformations with the highest probability of final occurrence are not necessarily the ones of lowest energy.},

@article{Chiang2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a new method for studying protein folding kinetics. It uses the recently introduced Stochastic Roadmap Simulation (SRS) method to estimate the transition state ensemble (TSE) and predict the rates and the Phi-values for protein folding. The new method was tested on 16 proteins, whose rates and Phi-values have been determined experimentally. Comparison with experimental data shows that our method estimates the TSE much more accurately than an existing method based on dynamic programming. This improvement leads to better folding-rate predictions. We also compute the mean first passage time of the unfolded states and show that the computed values correlate with experimentally determined folding rates. The results on Phi-value predictions are mixed, possibly due to the simple energy model used in the tests. This is the first time that results obtained from SRS have been compared against a substantial amount of experimental data. The results further validate the SRS method and indicate its potential as a general tool for studying protein folding kinetics.},

@article{Hobohm1992,
abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30\% identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server "netserv@embl-heidelberg.de." The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.},

This method combines analysis of individual discrete voids with analysis of packing quality. While these are different aspects of the same effect, they have traditionally been analysed using different approaches. The method has been applied to the calculation of total void volume and maximum void size in a non-redundant set of protein domains and has been used to examine correlations between thermal stability and void size. The tumour-suppressor protein p53 has then been compared with the non-redundant data set to determine whether its low thermal stability results from poor packing. We found that p53 has average packing, but the detrimental effects of some previously unexplained mutations to p53 observed in cancer can be explained by the creation of unusually large voids.},

Intermediates that accumulate within the first few milliseconds of folding are, however, a common observation even for small single-domain proteins. Recent spectroscopic studies, coupled with quantitative kinetic analysis, suggest that folding is facilitated by the rapid formation of compact intermediates with some native-like structural features.},

@article{FedorovBaldwin97,
abstract = {The problem of how the linear amino acid sequence of a polypeptide folds to assume its unique tertiary structure is one of the most basic and challenging conundrums of contemporary science. Many of the principles and characteristics of protein folding have been learned by studying refolding of denatured polypeptides. However, the problem of protein folding cannot be completely understood without reference to the biological context of protein folding, especially for large, multidomain, and multisubunit proteins. One of the basic differences between biosynthetic protein folding and protein renaturation is cotranslational folding, folding that occurs during synthesis. The elegant idea that the process of protein folding is concomitant with synthesis was articulated, and experimental testing was begun in the early 1960s (1, 2). Today there is substantial experimental support for the cotranslational folding hypothesis. Both cotranslational and cotranslocational folding, at least when the latter is coupled to translation, share the basic feature of vectorial appearance of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome or the membrane and the potential initiation of the folding process by the emerging polypeptide. It is true that the same conformations are achieved by polypeptides folded in cells as a consequence of biosynthetic processes and as a result of refolding of the full-length polypeptide from the denatured state. However, identity of the final protein structures does not necessarily mean identity of the pathways leading to their formation (3). It is the kinetics of the folding process that establishes the folding pathway(s) and potential partitioning among different final forms and, ultimately, their relative yields. In fact, the biological function that is shared by all proteins is the ability to fold properly, and this function must be executed efficiently by all proteins prior to any other function. This seems to be the essence of the vectorial folding process. Several general patterns and principles of cotranslational folding are summarized in Figs. 1 and 2.},

abstract = {We have used the occluded surface algorithm to estimate the packing of both buried and exposed amino acid residues in protein structures. This method works equally well for buried residues and solvent-exposed residues in contrast to the commonly used Voronoi method that works directly only on buried residues. The atomic packing of individual globular proteins may vary significantly from the average packing of a large data set of globular proteins. Here, we demonstrate that these variations in protein packing are due to a complex combination of protein size, secondary structure composition and amino acid composition. Differences in protein packing are conserved in protein families of similar structure despite significant sequence differences. This conclusion indicates that quality assessments of packing in protein structures should include a consideration of various parameters including the packing of known homologous proteins. Also, modeling of protein structures based on homologous templates should take into account the packing of the template protein structure.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is a common goal in biology, and is usually facilitated by having an accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

("Sandy") Ogston, and finally back at Wisconsin with Williams and Lou Gosting. In 1959 I joined Arthur Kornberg's Biochemistry Department at Stanford University. Our first work was physical studies of DNA replication and then DNA physical chemistry, and DNA studies ended with the energetics of DNA twisting. In 1971 we began to search for protein folding intermediates by fast-reaction methods. We found the slow-folding and fast-folding forms of unfolded ribonuclease A, which led to the understanding that proline isomerization is sometimes part of the folding process. Using hydrogen exchange as a probe, we found the rapid formation of secondary structure during folding and used this to provide an NMR pulse labeling method for determining structures of folding intermediates. Our studies of peptide helices provided basic helix-coil parameters, also evidence for hierarchic folding, and further indicated that peptide hydrogen bonds are important in the energetics of folding.},

A fractional population of the unfolded chains collapses on the 1 100 $\mu$s timescale to a compact intermediate IC containing some native-like secondary structure. Although the existence and nature of IC as a discrete folding intermediate remains controversial, there is extensive high time-resolution kinetic evidence for the rapid formation of IC as a true intermediate, i.e., a metastable state separated from the unfolded state by a discrete free energy barrier. Final folding to the native state takes place on millisecond and longer timescales, depending on the presence of kinetic traps such as heme misligation and proline mis-isomerization. The high folding rates observed in equilibrium molten globule models suggest that IC may be a productive folding intermediate. Whether it is an obligatory step on the pathway to the high free energy barrier associated with millisecond timescale folding to the native state, however, remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Stabilization of protein structures and protein-protein interactions are critical in the engineering of industrially useful enzymes and in the design of pharmaceutically valuable ligands. Hydrophobic interactions involving phenylalanine residues play crucial roles in protein stability and protein-protein/peptide interactions. To establish an effective method to explore the hydrophobic environments of phenylalanine residues, we present a strategy that uses pentafluorophenylalanine (F5Phe) and cyclohexylalanine (Cha). In this study, substitution of F5Phe or Cha for three Phe residues at positions 328, 338, and 341 in the tetramerization domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53 was performed. These residues are located at the interfaces of p53-p53 interactions and are important in the stabilization of the tetrameric structure. The stability of the p53 tetrameric structure did not change significantly when F5Phe-containing peptides at positions Phe328 or Phe338 were used. In contrast, the substitution of Cha for Phe341 in the hydrophobic core enhanced the stability of the tetrameric structure with a T(m) value of 100 degrees C. Phe328 and Phe338 interact with each other through pi-interactions, whereas Phe341 is buried in the surrounding alkyl side-chains of the hydrophobic core of the p53 tetramerization domain. Furthermore, high pressure-assisted denaturation analysis indicated improvement in the occupancy of the hydrophobic core. Considerable stabilization of the p53 tetramer was achieved by filling the identified cavity in the hydrophobic core of the p53 tetramer. The results indicate the status of the Phe residues, indicating that the "pair substitution" of Cha and F5Phe is highly suitable for probing the environments of Phe residues.},

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

abstract = {The folding of many small proteins is kinetically a two-state process that represents overcoming the major free-energy barrier. A kinetic characteristic of a conformation, its probability to descend to the native state domain in the amount of time that represents a small fraction of total folding time, has been introduced to determine to which side of the free-energy barrier a conformation belongs. However, which features make a protein conformation on the folding pathway become committed to rapidly descending to the native state has been a mystery. Using two small, well characterized proteins, CI2 and C-Src SH3, we show how topological properties of protein conformations determine their kinetic ability to fold. We use a macroscopic measure of the protein contact network topology, the average graph connectivity, by constructing graphs that are based on the geometry of protein conformations. We find that the average connectivity is higher for conformations with a high folding probability than for those with a high probability to unfold. Other macroscopic measures of protein structural and energetic properties such as radius of gyration, rms distance, solvent-accessible surface area, contact order, and potential energy fail to serve as predictors of the probability of a given conformation to fold.},

A microcanonical analysis, where the energy is the natural variable, has proved to be better suited than its canonical counterpart to unambiguously characterize the nature of the transition. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a high-resolution coarse-grained model allow for the accurate evaluation of the density of states in order to extract precise thermodynamic information and measure its impact on structural features. The method has been applied to three helical peptides: a short helix shows sharp features of a two-state folder, while a longer helix and a three-helix bundle exhibit downhill and two-state transitions, respectively. Extending the results of lattice simulations and theoretical models, we have found that it is the interplay between secondary structure and the loss of non-native tertiary contacts that determines the nature of the transition.},

abstract = {The prediction of protein structure from sequence remains a major unsolved problem in biology. The most successful protein structure prediction methods make use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to attack the problem: a conformational sampling method generates plausible candidate structures, which are subsequently accepted or rejected using an energy function. Conceptually, this often corresponds to separating local structural bias from the long-range interactions that stabilize the compact, native state. However, sampling protein conformations that are compatible with the local structural bias encoded in a given protein sequence is a long-standing open problem, especially in continuous space. We describe an elegant and mathematically rigorous method to do this, and show that it readily generates native-like protein conformations simply by enforcing compactness. Our results have far-reaching implications for protein structure prediction, determination, simulation, and design.},

@article{ShiLin08,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Contact order is a topological descriptor that has been shown to be correlated with several interesting protein properties such as protein folding rates and protein transition state placements. Contact order has also been used to select for viable protein folds from ab initio protein structure prediction programs. For proteins of known three-dimensional structure, their contact order can be calculated directly. However, for proteins with unknown three-dimensional structure, there is no effective prediction method currently available.RESULTS:In this paper, we propose several simple yet very effective methods to predict contact order from the amino acid sequence only. One set of methods is based on a weighted linear combination of predicted secondary structure content and amino acid composition. Depending on the number of components used in these equations it is possible to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.857-0.870 between the observed and predicted contact order. A second method, based on sequence similarity to known three-dimensional structures, is able to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.977. We have also developed a much more robust implementation for calculating contact order directly from PDB coordinates that works for > 99\% PDB files. All of these contact order predictors and calculators have been implemented as a web server (see Availability and requirements section for URL).CONCLUSION:Protein contact order can be effectively predicted from the primary sequence, at the absence of three-dimensional structure. Three factors, percentage of residues in alpha helices, percentage of residues in beta strands, and sequence length, appear to be strongly correlated with the absolute contact order.},

@article{Bystroff2004,
abstract = {This article reviews recent work towards modelling protein folding pathways using a bioinformatics approach. Statistical models have been developed for sequence-structure correlations in proteins at five levels of structural complexity: (i) short motifs; (ii) extended motifs; (iii) nonlocal pairs of motifs; (iv) 3-dimensional arrangements of multiple motifs; and (v) global structural homology. We review statistical models, including sequence profiles, hidden Markov models (HMMs) and interaction potentials, for the first four levels of structural detail. The I-sites (folding Initiation sites) Library models short local structure motifs. Each succeeding level has a statistical model, as follows: HMMSTR (HMM for STRucture) is an HMM for extended motifs; HMMSTR-CM (Contact Maps) is a model for pairwise interactions between motifs; and SCALI-HMM (HMMs for Structural Core ALIgnments) is a set of HMMs for the spatial arrangements of motifs. The parallels between the statistical models and theoretical models for folding pathways are discussed in this article; however, global sequence models are not discussed because they have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. The data used and algorithms presented in this article are available at http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/\~{}bystrc/ (click on "servers" or "downloads") or by request to bystrc@rpi.edu .},

abstract = {It has long been known that a protein's amino acid sequence dictates its native structure. However, despite significant recent advances, an ensemble description of how a protein achieves its native conformation from random coil under physiologically relevant conditions remains incomplete. Here we present a detailed all-atom model with a transferable potential that is capable of ab initio folding of entire protein domains using only sequence information. The computational efficiency of this model allows us to perform thousands of microsecond-time scale-folding simulations of the engrailed homeodomain and to observe thousands of complete independent folding events. We apply a graph-theoretic analysis to this massive data set to elucidate which intermediates and intermediary states are common to many trajectories and thus important for the folding process. This method provides an atomically detailed and complete picture of a folding pathway at the ensemble level. The approach that we describe is quite general and could be used to study the folding of proteins on time scales orders of magnitude longer than currently possible.},

abstract = {We propose a novel method for ab-initio prediction of protein tertiary structures based on the fragment assembly and global optimization. Fifteen residue long fragment libraries are constructed using the secondary structure prediction method PREDICT, and fragments in these libraries are assembled to generate full-length chains of a query protein. Tertiary structures of 50 to 100 conformations are obtained by minimizing an energy function for proteins, using the conformational space annealing method that enables one to sample diverse low-lying local minima of the energy. Then in order to enhance the performance of the prediction method, we optimize the linear parameters of the energy function, so that the native-like conformations become energetically more favorable than the non-native ones for proteins with known structures. We test the feasibility of the parameter optimization procedure by applying it to the training set consisting of three proteins: the 10–55 residue fragment of staphylococcal protein A (PDB ID 1bdd), a designed protein betanova, and 1fsd.},

abstract = {Theoretical studies have suggested relationships between the size, stability and topology of a protein fold and the rate and mechanisms by which it is achieved. The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state. The correlation between topological complexity and folding rates may reflect chain entropy contributions to the folding barrier.},

@article{FlemingRose06,
abstract = {Using a test set of 13 small, compact proteins, we demonstrate that a remarkably simple protocol can capture native topology from secondary structure information alone, in the absence of long-range interactions. It has been a long-standing open question whether such information is sufficient to determine a protein’s fold. Indeed, even the far simpler problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its exact backbone torsion angles has remained a difficult challenge owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, cause large errors in structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm; the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Here, correct secondary structure assignments (a-helix, b-strand, b-turn, polyproline II, coil) were used to constrain polypeptide backbone chains devoid of side chains, and the most stable folded conformations were determined, using Monte Carlo simulation. Just three terms were used to assess stability: molecular compaction, steric exclusion, and hydrogen bonding. For nine of the 13 proteins, this protocol restricts the main chain to a surprisingly small number of energetically favorable topologies, with the native one prominent among them.},

Last, it serves as a visual framework to monitor and steer a protein structure prediction process that may be running on a remote machine. ProteinShop was used to create initial configurations for a protein structure prediction method developed by a team that competed in CASP5. ProteinShop's use accelerated the process of generating initial configurations, reducing the time required from days to hours.

abstract = {Globular proteins fold by minimizing the nonpolar surface that is exposed to water, while simultaneously providing hydrogen-bonding interactions for buried backbone groups, usually in the form of secondary structures such as alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and tight turns. A primary thermodynamic driving force for the formation of globular structure is thus the sequestration of nonpolar groups, but the correlation between the parts of proteins that are observed to fold first (termed folding initiation sites) and the "hydrophobicity" (as customarily defined) of the amino acids in these regions has been quite weak. It has previously been noted that many amino acid side chains contain considerable nonpolar sections, even if they also contain polar or charged groups. For example, a lysine side chain contains four methylenes, which may undergo hydrophobic interactions if the charged epsilon-NH(3)(+) group is salt-bridged or hydrogen-bonded. Folding initiation sites might therefore contain not only accepted "hydrophobic" amino acids, but also larger charged side chains. Recent experiments on the folding of mutant apomyoglobins provides corroboration for models based on the hypothesis that folding initiation sites arise from hydrophobic interactions. A near-perfect correlation was observed between the areas of the molecule that are present in the burst-phase kinetic intermediate and both the free energy of formation of hydrophobic initiation sites and the parameter "average area buried upon folding," which pinpoints large side chains, even those containing charged or polar portions. These results provide a putative mechanism for the control of protein-folding initiation and growth by polar/nonpolar sequence propensity alone.},

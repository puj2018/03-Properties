Fifteen of the 32 analytical properties calculated as standard for all Dynameo-
mics targets (10) were included in the property space: 
	- native contacts, 
	- nonnative contacts, 
	- radius of gyration, 
	- end-to-end distance, 
	- main-chain SASA,
	- side-chain SASA, 
	- polar SASA, 
	- nonpolar SASA, 
	- main-chain polar SASA,
	- main-chain nonpolar SASA, 
	- side-chain polar SASA, 
	- side-chain nonpolar SASA, 
	- total SASA, 
	- fraction of helix, and 
	- fraction of b. 

SASA was calculated
according to the algorithm of Lee and Richards (23) with a probe radius of
1.4 AÌŠ. The 15 properties were chosen so that there would be minimal compar-
ison to a reference structure (e.g., Ca RMSD and CONGENEAL scores (24)
were discarded because they are relative to the starting structure), and protein-
wide descriptors were preferred over residue-wide (e.g., V and j angles) or
atomic-level descriptors. It was necessary for the properties to be general
enough to be applicable to all the protein metafolds within the 188 proteins
so that the general features of the RXN coordinate could be determined.
The 15 properties were compiled from each simulation of a particular
